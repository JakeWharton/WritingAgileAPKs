Writing Agile APKs
==================

Learn how libraries like ActionBarSherlock, ViewPagerIndicator, NineOldAndroids
and other creatively named libraries alleviate the burden of dealing with
platform differences yourself. Googleâ€™s support library creates a phenomenal
starting point for providing post-Honeycomb style content management. What is
missing, however, is a bit of visual sugar to allow for leveraging things like
animation and the action bar paradigm without having to juggle native class
availability across various API levels.

With minimal effort, we can instead call on third-party libraries to step up and
handle these implementations, which will allow you, the developer, more time to
focus on making the content of your app the best it can be! This session will
include a live coding example, demos, use cases, and a showcase of existing
implementations of the libraries covered.
